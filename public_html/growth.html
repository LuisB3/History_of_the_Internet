        <ul>
            <li> In 1994 at Stanford University, <span><b>Jerry Yang</b></span>  and <span><b>David Filo</b></span>  were goofing around and hit on an idea that would become the basis for one of America's best-known businesses, called <span><b>Yahoo</b></span>.
            </li>
            <li>Michael Moritz saw its potential and invested $2M in Yang and Filo's website with an exciting, unique name.
            </li>
            <li>
                Yahoo's most formidable rival was a company called Excite, another search startup.  Excite would use the typed in queries and crawl the web finding pages that contain the searched keywords.
            </li>
            <li>
                By 1997, millions of people flocked online to check out companies like Yahoo, Excite and the other search engines.
            </li>
            <li>
                A new search engine named after a mathematical term for 10 to the hundredth power, <span><b>Google</b></span>, was founded by a pair of young geeks <span><b>Larry Page</b></span> and <span><b>Sergey Brin</b></span> , who met in the spring of 1996 on a guided tour of San Francisco for prospective graduate students at Stanford.
            </li>
            <li>
                Google interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote by page A for page B.  Simply put, it assesses a page’s importance by the votes it receives.
            </li>
            <li>
                Although it had great potential, every search company in Silicon Valley turned them down flat. Excite could have bought Google for about a $1M but just walked away from a deal of a lifetime.  But Andy Bechtel Cheyne, a well-known Silicon Valley investor, gave $100,000 to Google on the spot.
            </li>
            <li>
                An idea by Bill Gross spawned the concept that a search engine could be the world's most powerful and efficient market research tool and become profitable through the sale of keywords searched by people.  On August 19, 2004, Google went public listing its shares for sale on the Nasdaq stock market and was a huge success.

            <li>
                In mid-2003, <span><b>MySpace</b></span> was founded by <span><b>Krista Wolff</b></span> and <span><b>Tom Anderson</b></span>, a site very similar to a person's bedroom whereby on their MySpace page there's different colors and there's music playing in the background with photos of a person's friends.  By the summer of 2005, MySpace seemed to be everywhere all of a sudden.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rupert Murdoch, the man who presided over the globe spanning media empire that is News Corp, bought Myspace at the height of the Internet bubble.
            </li>
            <li>
                But by 2004, <span><b>Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook</b></span> took over where MySpace left off and turned it into the Microsoft Windows of the web.  It became a platform on which software developers could build applications to make the site more useful and all-encompassing and along the way develop a whole new model of advertising through social media.
